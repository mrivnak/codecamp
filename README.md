# Codecamp (Attendance Tracker)

### Usage (Deployment)
Steps:  
This project is configured to be docker deployable. All that is needed is the repository and docker.

- Follow steps for docker-compose installation here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

- Clone the repository with "git clone <repo>"

- In the root directory of the repository, run "docker-compose up -d" to run the server inside a container. The server will open port 8000 automatically.
